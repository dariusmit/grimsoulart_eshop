            Grimsoul Art â€“ my pseudonym, my real name is Darius Molotokas and I
            am Dark / Skull artist from Lithuania. I express my own passions for
            the darker side of the world and pen and ink is what shapes it. I am
            heavily inspired by the heavy metal, rock and goth music, horror and
            other dark, deep, twisted films or books. I take inspiration from
            such great artists as Mark Riddick, Chris Moyen, Blial Cabal,
            Defame, Godmachine also the bands Motorhead, Metallica, AC/DC, Black
            Sabbath, Darkthrone, Archgoat, Acid Witch, Gaahls Wyrd, Lebanon
            Hanover, Joy Division, She Past Away and many more are all idols of
            mine. In my free time I do like to play electric guitar, ride a bike
            or indulge in a great movie or book.
