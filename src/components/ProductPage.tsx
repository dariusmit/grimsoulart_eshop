                to obtain some artwork for my business. Both times he has
                provided exceptional work, constant updates and friendly and
                helpful communications. He is fantastic at listening to ideas
                and presenting them through his artwork. He was able to make all
                suggested edits and the final products always came out even
                better than we anticipated. His prices were always fair and our
                tips were always warranted. We will continue to use Darius for
                many more art projects to come!"
